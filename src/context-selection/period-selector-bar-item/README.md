# Period selector

I copied this stuff from the approvals app. As this code is only used by the
period selector, I moved it to this particular location. If it's being used by
other parts of the app as well, the shared parts should be moved to
`src/shared/period`.

###### Note by @mohammer5

I think we should move this to its own library at some
point as this functionality is being used through out many of our apps
