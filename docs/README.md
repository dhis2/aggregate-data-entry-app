# Data Entry

The Data Entry app is where you manually enter aggregated data in DHIS2. You
register data for an organisation unit, a period, and a set of data elements
(data set) at a time. A data set often corresponds to a paper-based data
collection tool. You configure the data sets in the Maintenance app.

**Note:**

If a data set has both a section form and a custom form, the system displays
the custom form during data entry. Users who enter data can't select which form
they want to use. In web-based data entry the order of display preference is:

1. Custom form (if it exists)
1. Section form (if it exists)
1. Default form

<!-- @TODO: We don't support mobile browser currently, is this something we
need to support for feature parity? -->
Mobile devices do not support custom forms. In mobile-based data entry the
order of display preference is:

1. Section form (if it exists)
1. Default form
