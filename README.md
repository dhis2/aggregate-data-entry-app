# Data entry app

## Global state

We're using use-query-params to store part of the app's state in the url query
parameters. This allows users to bookmark and share specific states of the app.

## Model overview

The category model can be fairly confusing, so we've created a few diagrams to help explain and get an overview of how DHIS2 models are used in the app.
